Library for interfacing to the Zigbee API with erlang.
The erlang library itself(zigbee.erl) is licensed under GPL-2.

Serial code comes from http://www.erlang.org/user.html - serial-1.0.
It does not fall under the GPL-2 license.

My configuration (the only one that's (only partially) supported right now)

  Zigbee ZB Coordinator API Mode
    Connected to a USB Serial adapter
    VR = 2164 (SW Version)
    HV = 1941 (HW Version)
    AO = 1

  Zigbee ZB Router AT Mode
    Connected to an Arduino pro mini from sparkfun
    DIO3 connected to Arduino reset pin
    DH = 0
    DL = 0

I think that covers everything unique about my setup.
